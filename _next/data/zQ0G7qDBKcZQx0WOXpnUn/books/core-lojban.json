In that regard English (despite being often ambiguous and having complex grammar) can still be used to relay the basics of Lojban. At first let's try to describe a portion of the English language using Lojban terms:</p>\n  <p>\n    \"I love you\" is a bridi.\n    \"love\" is its selbri\n    \"I\" and \"you\" make up its terbri.\n  </p>\n  <p>In layment terms:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>bridi is the relationship</li>\n    <li>selbri is the relation</li>\n    <li>terbri is a sequence of arguments in the relationship</li>\n  </ul><!-- Rephrasing in math terms:\n  * bridi is the expression with a function like `f(1,2)`\n  * selbri is the function `f(x,y)`\n  * terbri is the sequence of arguments `1,2`\n  The return value of the function can be thought of as always returning `true`. Consider a function `it is true that x is less than y`. -->\n  <p>Rephrasing in linguistic terms:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>bridi is a clause</li>\n    <li>selbri is the content verb, predicate</li>\n    <li>terbri is a sequence of arguments, roles in the clause</li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n","toc":[]}},"__N_SSG":true}
